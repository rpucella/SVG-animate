is there a way to associate an animation with an element?
how do we lauch the anim?  element.animate()?

object-oriented syntax for animations?

note: rotate(r,10) --> rotates by 10

rotate(r,S)  --> rotates by S, but S time-varies

  rotate(r).angle(10)
  delay(r).time(10)

How do we animate two figures at the same time?

element(r)  <-- grabs it
returns a stream of that element
threshold(s1,t,s2)  <-  s1 until t then s2

delay(ms,S)

select(B,S1,S2)   <- if time-varying B is true then S1 else S2

over(S1,S2,S3,S4,...)   <- in parallel

scale(ELT,S)

a -> 10
