is there a way to associate an animation with an element?
how do we lauch the anim?  element.animate()?

But we want to go beyond: we want to animate groups of elements as
one, so we should be able to define behaviors independently of the
underlying element. 

Alternately, use combinator algebra to pull the "over" (which is the
one thing that can use different elements?) up at top-level, and then
we can push the various per-element animations into each element.

object-oriented syntax for animations?

note: rotate(r,10) --> rotates by 10

rotate(r,S)  --> rotates by S, but S time-varies

  rotate(r).angle(10)
  delay(r).time(10)

How do we animate two figures at the same time?

element(r)  <-- grabs it
returns a stream of that element
threshold(s1,t,s2)  <-  s1 until t then s2

delay(ms,S)

select(B,S1,S2)   <- if time-varying B is true then S1 else S2

over(S1,S2,S3,S4,...)   <- in parallel

scale(ELT,S)

a -> 10


An interesting behavior to toss into the mix, of course, is a good ol'
D3 transition, which is a transition with a given duration that can
fit in nicely within a larger behavior. It does mean we might need to
figure out how to notice the "end" of a behavior. Or maybe there's an
implicit "duration" in use?

Make sure we can do recursive thresholds.

Rename 'threshold' to 'then'?
